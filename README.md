# conanLocalLogger
Logs text from local chat using Tot ! Chat's Webhook feature

Install instructions:


1. In Conan, open the Tot ! Chat settings by hitting the cog on the chat box. Under the Roleplay category on the left side,  select "Chat & UI Settings". On the far right in the "Webhook box" check the "Enable Webhook" Box, then Enter <http://localhost:8080> without the carots in the Webhook URL spot. HIT SAVE IN BOTTOM RIGHT AFTER YOU'VE DONE THIS.
2. Install python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Put the conanLogger.py file in its own folder somewhere (I recommend creating a folder in the root of your C: drive, like C:\conanLogger)
4. open up command prompt and change directory to the folder where the conanLogger.py file is at, and once you've changed directory to that directly, run "python conanLogger.py"

Your logs will be added to a text file in the folder where the conanLogger.py file was placed. Remember to start it when you start Conan!
